# THL9Automation

This is the code I used to track progress in THL 9. Use this code requires the Jaunt library. 

The code does the following
1) Traverse through the participant_list line by line
2) Create THL teams and members based on the list
3) Scrapes information from the member's PSNP page
4) Outputs all information for BBCode leaderboard purposes as well as a .csv

There are some extra classes in this that I was planning to use, but ended up not implementing.

THL 9 ended July 31st, but I am still using this to implement some post-THL stat retrieval.

Progression since last video:

Thought through everything, extra automation isn't feasible with amount of time I have left

Added backlog-esque 90s trophies check
    Participants submit completed 90s trophies
    Code checks that the game is on the list then counts the THL trophies
    Output to CSV

Need to do:

*** If PST name == PSN name, don't print it twice on BBCode output

Add backlog-esque completed games check

**** Check the game IDs first against the 90s list, then use each line as the incremental for 90s game trophies
**** then continue on with the unique games completed check

90s trophies
	Pull ID of game from PSNP
	If it matches one of the many, go to that PSNP.com\psn page and pull number of trophies based on time stamp

90 unique games
	Pull ID of game from PSNP
	Compare with 5 other teammates, count uniques
	
*** HOW WILL I PULL THIS INFO ***

Add more column to participant_list: last log processed, 90s games count
each day, I will pull the URLs of trophies from completed games, but only save the unique IDs/URLs (ingore any line that contains <a class="dlc-icon")
Then after each person is complete, I will open that the page for each game and check the "base game" percentage
If it is 100%, I will add it to the "completed" game list of that person and export it to a CSV for further processing 
	Checking unique IDs against teammates
Each new completed game will also get compared against the 90s games ID and 90s games count will be incrememted
--- but how do i get the "last log" and "90s count" back into the participants list?



Possibility of trophy-level stats
	I was thinking about this and I may have to do the  individual trophy pull after the event completes
	since the rarity_type level may change drastically during the event...

Add PSNTL identifier for basic info pulls

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added Export Data option to allow me to save off all the daily information into a spreadsheet
    Team totals
    Daily individual numbers
Added platinum leaderboard


Fixed Platinum leaderboard, I realized it was printing PSTName (PSTName)
Added Inter-team LB
Realized I can't add version control.
    Not that I can't, but that I don't have the GitHub plan that would allow me to hide it.
 Added PSNTL basic info scraping


Re-sort InterTeam by alphabet before BBCode
Output leaderboard things to a file


Set up automation to run using Task Scheduler, did it on main computer and not on spare laptop yet.
    Seems to work well (so long as I have the laptop open)

Added ScrapePSNPLog class
    This will allow me to gather games being played
Added ScrapePSNPGamePage
    This will allow me to check if the game has been completed or not

Subscriber info output - added * next to individual trophy LB if member has reached 470. Average is 469.08
